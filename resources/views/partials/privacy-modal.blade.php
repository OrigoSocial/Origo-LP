                <strong>Use of Cookies</strong>
                <p>
                    The Origo website may use &quot;cookies&quot; to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie
                    is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run
                    programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can
                    only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The
                    purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For
                    example, if you personalize Origo pages, or register with Origo site or services, a cookie helps
                    Origo to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of
                    recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on.
                    When you return to the same Origo website, the information you previously provided can be
                    retrieved, so you can easily use the Origo features that you customized.
                </p>

                    You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept
                    cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you
                    choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the
                    Origo services or websites you visit.
                </p>

                <strong>Security of your Personal Information</strong>
                <p>
                    Origo secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When
